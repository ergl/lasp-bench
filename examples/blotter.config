%% Can do ping | readonly | writeonly | readwrite | readonly_track
%% readonly_track is the same as readonly with 1 key, where we
%% track the different parts of a read operation
%% In order to work correctly, Antidote needs to be compiled
%% with the option `read_request`
{operations,[
    {readonly,1}
]}.

%% The number of keys read in the readonly op
{read_keys, 1}.

%% The number of keys read in the writeonly op
{written_keys, 1}.

%% Key ratio for the readwrite op
%% The first number is the number of keys to read
%% The second the number of keys to update
{ratio, {1, 1}}.

%% Number of tries an aborted operation is retried
%% Applies to writeonly and readwrite operations
{abort_retries, 1}.
